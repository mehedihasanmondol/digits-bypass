## A WordPress plugin to edit.

 
**Plugin type**: WordPress otp login \
**Edit type**: Need customize otp provider to be added. \
**Plugin name**: Digits \
**Plugin link**: https://digits.unitedover.com/

Digits plugin to login by phone OTP. Currently. Need to use ADN message and/or bulkSMSbd. 

But the existing system doesn't have the gateway. \
So edit the plugin and add the gateways.

As with the existing system, \
We want to choose the gateway name and want to put in the gateway details and expect it to work.

**Update Preview:**
